## About Me

- __Bio:__ I hold a bachelor’s degree in applied ecology from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Nigeria. I was very lucky that after my national youth service I got a sponsorship for a master's degree in conservation biology at [A.P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI)](http://aplori.org), University of Jos, Nigeria, where I was trained in both conservation biology and ornithology.
- As a student at APLORI, I was fascinated by birds in-flight and how aircraft are nature-inspired, yet the conflicts that exist between birds and aircraft (bird strikes) using the same airspace. So, I decided to study how birds utilize airports landscape in Nigeria. I studied the factors that attract birds within and around the airports relating it to bird and bird strikes data, and its implication for both avian and aviation safety.
- __Interest:__ I am research-oriented and very enthusiastic about eduction.I honestly believe that no research question is too complex, and knowledge and research outcomes are meant to be communicated in a simple and engaging way to a wide audience. 
-I have a strong interest in GIS & remote sensing, data science, birds and birdstrike risk assessment.
